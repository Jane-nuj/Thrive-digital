## Development Workflow & Best Practices
- [ ] Ensure Next.js development server (`npm run dev`) is stopped when not actively working to conserve system resources.
- [ ] Regularly check Activity Monitor for any `next-router-worker` or `node` processes consuming high CPU after stopping the dev server.
- [ ] If high CPU usage persists, manually terminate the lingering processes using Activity Monitor or `kill <PID>` command.
- [ ] Consider restarting VS Code or the entire machine if rogue processes cannot be easily terminated.
- [ ] Before committing changes, ensure the dev server is stopped to avoid accidental inclusion of server-related artifacts.
