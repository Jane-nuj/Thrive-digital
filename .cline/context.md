# Thrive Digital Site - Development Context

## Project Overview
This is a portfolio/freelancer website for Jane Fletcher featuring a clean, minimal design with dark charcoal background and gold accents. The site uses Manrope for headings and Poppins for body text, and features a mobile-first responsive layout with a working contact form.

## Recent Updates (2025-05-13)
### Mobile Typography Consistency Fix
We fixed an inconsistency in heading sizes between pages on mobile:
1. The contact page h1 ("Let me know how I can help") was appearing larger than the homepage h1 ("Need a contractor who has") in mobile view
2. Updated the contact page h1 to use the same responsive text sizing approach as the homepage (`text-2xl sm:text-3xl md:text-h1`)
3. Added `leading-relaxed` class for consistent line height
4. Maintained the gold accent for the word "help" while adjusting the overall size

This change ensures both headings scale proportionally as viewport sizes change, with the more restrained typography on smaller screens that was preferred.

### Homepage Content Update
We've implemented a comprehensive update to the homepage content and layout:

1. **Updated Content Sections**:
   - Refined hero section with improved messaging and spacing
   - Expanded Areas of Focus section with detailed service offerings
   - Added "How I Work" section outlining work approach and availability
   - Implemented "Work Philosophy" section highlighting values and methods
   - Added CTA section with prominent "Get in touch" button

2. **Visual & Layout Improvements**:
   - Refined spacing between all page sections for better visual rhythm
   - Improved typography with optimized line-height for headlines
   - Enhanced vertical spacing between paragraphs for better readability
   - Created consistent margins and padding throughout the page
   - Optimized mobile spacing and responsive layout

### Earlier Updates
We also fixed several layout and styling issues:

1. **Gold Color Consistency**: Standardized the gold color across the site to use #b77f0f
2. **Content Alignment**: Aligned content with the left hand side of the logo for visual consistency
3. **Sticky Navigation**: Made the menu bar persist on screen when scrolling with a subtle shadow
4. **Footer Consistency**: Standardized the footer to use white background with black text on all pages
5. **Navigation Color**: Ensured the navigation bar uses the same color across all pages
6. **Contact Page Color Alignment**: Fixed the Contact link in header and Send button text to display in white instead of gold
7. **Design Consistency**: Improved visual hierarchy by reserving gold color only for accent text like "help"
8. **Mobile Navigation Alignment**: Fixed hamburger menu icon position to align properly on the right side
9. **Responsive Typography**: Improved h1 heading display on mobile with responsive font sizes and better text wrapping
10. **Contact Page Spacing**: Increased vertical spacing between navbar and contact page title for better visual hierarchy

## Tech Stack
- Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Deployed on Vercel

## Project Structure
- `/app`: Main application pages using Next.js App Router
- `/components`: Reusable UI components
- `/public`: Static assets
- `tailwind.config.js`: Tailwind configuration including custom colors and typography

## Development Process
- **Server Management**: It's important to stop the Next.js development server (`npm run dev`) when not actively working. This helps prevent high CPU usage from lingering `next-router-worker` or `node` processes. If high CPU usage is observed after stopping the server, these processes may need to be manually terminated via Activity Monitor or the `kill <PID>` command.
