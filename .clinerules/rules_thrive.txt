## Design System
- Use Manrope for headings and Poppins for body, buttons, and forms
- Apply Tailwind colour palette:
  - White: #ffffff
  - Off-white: #f2f2f2
  - Gold (accent): #b77f0f
  - Charcoal: #2a2a2a
  - Black: #000000
- Maintain dark background and minimal contrast for visual calm

## Layout Guidelines
- Mobile-first responsive layout
- Hero section uses bold stacked text
- Contact form is full-width with gold-outline button and minimal borders
- Footer is white on contact page, black elsewhere
- Use `min-h-screen` to prevent layout collapse

## Writing Tone
- Confident, clear, and grounded
- Avoid fluff or filler language
- Use short, scannable paragraphs
- CTA should invite without pressure (“drop me a line”)

## Site Structure
- Two pages: `Home` and `Contact`
- Internal links only (`/contact`, `/`)
- Layout is consistent across pages (header, footer, spacing)
