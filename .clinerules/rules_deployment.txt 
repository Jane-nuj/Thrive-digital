## Vercel Deployment Standards
- Use automatic deployments from main branch for production
- Set up preview deployments for pull requests to test changes before merging
- Configure proper build settings in vercel.json if needed
- Follow branch-based workflow: feature branches → main → production

## Environment Variables
- Store all sensitive information as environment variables
- Required variables:
  - RESEND_API_KEY: For email functionality in contact form
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL: Base URL for canonical links
- Never hard-code sensitive information in application code
- Create separate environment sets for development and production

## Domain Configuration
- Set up custom domain in Vercel dashboard
- Configure HTTPS with automatic SSL certificate
- Set up proper redirects from www to non-www (or vice versa)
- Ensure proper DNS configuration with recommended TTL values

## Monitoring & Error Handling
- Enable Vercel Analytics for performance monitoring
- Create custom 404.tsx page in app directory matching site design
- Create error.tsx for handling 500 errors with fallback UI
- Set up error logging with Vercel integration or external service
- Monitor core web vitals through Vercel dashboard

## CI/CD Pipeline
- Automate testing before deployment where possible
- Use GitHub actions for additional pre-deployment checks if needed
- Follow atomic deployments - all or nothing approach
- Verify successful deployments with automated checks

## Performance Optimization
- Enable caching for static assets through Vercel configuration
- Implement proper cache-control headers
- Configure image optimization options
- Use Vercel Edge Network for global CDN distribution

## Rollback Strategy
- Test rollback procedure for critical changes
- Document deployment versions and changes
- Maintain ability to quickly revert to previous working version

## Security
- Configure Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Implement rate limiting for API routes, especially contact form
- Scan dependencies regularly for vulnerabilities
- Set up proper CORS policy for API endpoints
